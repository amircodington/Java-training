In Java, strings refer to sequences of characters that behave like an object within the Java environment. It’s a very common and widely used Java data structure, storing data in an array of characters. Creating a simple application that reverses a string can help you understand strings and how they’re used in a Java environment.

For example, creating a program that reverses a string the user enters (e.g., “HELLO” to “OLLEH”). This project has many possible solutions, which is a key concept to understand as you start coding. And, oftentimes the best solution can change depending on the attributes and objective of the project you’re working on.
